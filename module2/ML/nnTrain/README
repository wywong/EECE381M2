Use nnTrain.m to train the neural network
  nnTrain creates theta.mat, theta1.csv and theta2.csv
  theta1.csv and theta2.csv will be used by the android application

Use check.m to test the theta values generated by nnTrain against
  photos of characters found in the photos folder

Use hidden.m to test the neural network with different numbers
  of hidden units

Use regularize.m to determine test the neural network with multiple
  lambda values
